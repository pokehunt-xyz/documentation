# Catching

Catching Pokémon is one of the core mechanics of the bot. As you chat and interact in the group or a private chat, Pokémon will randomly spawn.

After a spawn has occured, you have to type `/catch pokeName` where pokeName is the exact name of the Pokémon that spawned (which can be seen in the image). If you do not know the name, you can use `/hint` to get a hint.

<Aside>You can only catch the most recently spawned Pokémon, and only the first user to guess correctly can catch it</Aside>

<Aside type="caution">Make sure you enter the Pokémon's name exactly, incorrect names will not work</Aside>

# Hunting

Instead of needing to wait for a random spawn, you can also run `/hunt` (once every 10 minutes) to hunt for a random Pokémon. After that, you can decide if you want to capture it or release it back to the whild (not capture it).
