Catching Pokémon is one of the core mechanics of the bot. Here is a detailed guide:

How Pokémon Appear : 
As you chat and interact in the group or private chat, Pokémon randomly spawn.

The Catch Command
To catch the spawned Pokémon, use the following command:
/catch pokeName

Replace pokeName with the exact name of the Pokémon that spawned. For example, if a Bulbasaur spawns, type:
/catch Bulbasaur

Important Rules
You can only catch the most recently spawned Pokémon.
Make sure you enter the Pokémon's name exactly as it appears. Incorrect names won't work.
Only one user (the fastest) can catch each Pokémon, so be quick!

To obtain more Pokémon, run the command /hunt (only possible every 10 minutes).
