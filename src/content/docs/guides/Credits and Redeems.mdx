title: Economy: Credits and Redeems
description: Overview of in-game currencies and how to use them
---

In the game, there are two types of currencies: **Credits** and **Redeems**.

Use `/balance` to check your current amounts of both currencies.

**Credits** are the primary currency used to buy items and services from the shop. You can earn credits by completing quests, challenges, and winning duels.

**Redeems** are a rare currency with special uses:
- Use `/redeem spawn pokeName` to spawn a Pokémon of your choice.
- Use `/redeem credits` to get 15,000 credits instantly.

Redeems provide unique advantages and are harder to obtain than credits.
