Unlike the market, auctions work by bidding on Pokémon and end either after a set time or when the bid goal is reached.

To buy a Pokémon, use: /auction search

Then use: /auction view , to see details.

To place a bid, use: /auction bid or use button

To sell your Pokémon, use: /auction create , to list it with a set duration for bidding.

To view all your Pokémon listed in auctions, run: /auction listings , to manage your auctions.
