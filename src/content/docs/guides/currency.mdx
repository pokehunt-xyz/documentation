description: Overview of in game currencies and how to use them
---

In the bot, there are two types of currencies: **Credits** and **Redeems**.

Use [/balance](/commands/balance) to check your current balance of both currencies.

**Credits** are the primary currency used to buy items and services from the shop. You can earn credits by completing quests, challenges, and winning duels.

**Redeems** are a rare currency with special uses such as [/redeem spawn](/commands/redeem/spawn) to spawn a Pok√©mon of your choice and [/redeem credits](/commands/redeem/credits) to get 15,000 credits instantly.

Redeems provide unique advantages and are harder to obtain than credits.
