Duelling (battling) is a very important but difficult aspect of the Pokémon games.

First you should [/select](/commands/select) a good Pokémon you own, and using [/learn](/commands/learn) you can then learn it (up to 4) good moves to use in battle.

When you are ready to start a duel, use the [/duel](/commands/duel) command to start a battle between your selected Pokémon.

Winning a duel rewards your Pokémon with [XP](/guides/levelling) based on the difficulty of the battle. Your Pokémon can also earn [EVs](/guides/evs) based on which Pokémon it defeated and the winner can earn some [credits](/guides/currency).
