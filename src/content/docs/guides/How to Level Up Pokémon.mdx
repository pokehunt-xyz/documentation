description: Gaining experience and leveling up your Pokémon
---

To level up your Pokémon, you can earn experience (XP) by chatting in groups where the bot is present. Your selected Pokémon will gain XP automatically as you chat, helping it level up over time.
Additionally, you can use candy from the shop to instantly level up your Pokémon.

To select the Pokémon you want to level, run:
/select -1

Note: -1 means "latest," so this command selects your most recently caught Pokémon.
