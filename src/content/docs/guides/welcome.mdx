Hey there trainer! Welcome to the world of PokéHunt, the best Pokémon experience on Discord and Telegram

# Starting

Every beginner trainer can select their own starter Pokémon for free! Doing this will officially start your journey to becoming a Pokémon master.

<Steps>

1. Join the official (support) chat on a platform of your choice
   <CardGrid>
      <LinkCard
         title="Discord"
         href="https://discord.gg/cpYkJzd">
      </LinkCard>
      <LinkCard
         title="Telegram"
         href="https://t.me/pokehunt_xyz">
      </LinkCard>
   </CardGrid>

2. Run `/start` in one of the chats

3. Select any starter you want

</Steps>

# Linking other account

Once you have started on either Discord or Telegram, you can link your account with the other platform so that you can play on both. To do so, run `/settings link` and follow the instructions.

<Aside type="caution">To link your account, make sure you have started on either Discord OR Telegram but **NOT** on the other. If you have started on both platforms already, automatic linking is not possible and you need to contact support.</Aside>


# Getting help

In the same Discord or Telegram chat given above there are other trainers as well as admins and developers. If you ever have an issue or question, feel free to ask it in there! We do not bite (usually)
