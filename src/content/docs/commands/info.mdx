To view detailed information about a specific Pokémon, run the command:
/info 1

Here, 1 represents the Pokémon’s ID in your collection. Replace 1 with the ID number of the Pokémon you want to check.
This will display relevant details about that particular Pokémon, including stats and IVs.

Stats are the key attributes of your Pokémon such as HP, Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense and Speed which determine its performance in battles.

IVs (Individual Values) are hidden genetic points unique to each Pokémon, affecting how high each stat can potentially get.
Pokémon with higher IVs will have stronger stats compared to others of the same species.

To view more info of your selected Pokémon, run `/info 0`\nNote: 0 in this bot means "selected"
