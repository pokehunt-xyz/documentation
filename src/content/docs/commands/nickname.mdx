description: Give a Pokémon a nickname (or remove it)

To give your Pokémon a nickname, use the command:

`/nickname 1 BulbaGoat`

Here, 1 refers to the Pokémon ID, and BulbaGoat is the nickname you want to assign.

After naming, you can use the nickname as the Pokémon’s ID in commands, for example `/select BulbaGoat` and `/info BulbaGoat`
