title: Catch
description: Catch a Pokémon
---

In the game, random Pokémon will spawn while you are chatting. 
To catch one, you must use the /catch <pokemon> command where <pokemon> is the name of the Pokémon that appeared.

Important: Only the most recent spawned Pokémon can be caught using this command.

Usage examples:
/catch bulbasaur , 
catches Bulbasaur if it has been spawned in the group.

Pokémon spawn randomly as you chat.
You have to guess and use the correct name of the Pokémon to catch it.
If multiple players try to catch the same Pokémon, the first successful attempt wins.
If no one catches a Pokémon before another one spawns, it will disappear.
Catching Pokémon allows you to add them to your collection, earn rewards, and complete quests!
