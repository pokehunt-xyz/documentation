Use the command /auction create <id> [minimumBid] to put one of your Pokémon on auction.

<id>: The Pokémon you want to auction. You can use -1 for your latest Pokémon, 0 for the selected Pokémon, or the specific Pokémon’s ID.

[minimumBid] (optional): The minimum credits required to start bidding. If not specified, the default minimum bid applies.

Note: The auction duration is fixed at 1 day and 12 hours (36 hours) and cannot be changed.

Example commands:

/auction create -1 22 , 
Puts your latest Pokémon on auction with a minimum bid of 22 credits.

/auction create 0 50 , 
Puts your selected Pokémon on auction with a minimum bid of 50 credits.

The auction allows other players to place bids. After the duration ends, the highest bidder wins the Pokémon.
