Use the command:
/trade confirm , 
to confirm the ongoing trade. Once both users involved in the trade use the confirm command, the trade will be executed and the items, Pok√©mon, credits, or redeems exchanged between both parties.

This two-step confirmation ensures that both sides agree to the trade terms before completing the exchange, preventing misunderstandings or unwanted trades.
