title: Trade start
description: Start a trade with a user
---

Use the command:
/trade start \<@username\> ,
to initiate a trade request with another user. For example:

/trade start @psyche64 ,
This sends a trade request to the specified user to begin the trading process. 

If you want to start a trade with someone, simply reply to their message and use the command without specifying username:
/trade start ,
to begin the trade with the user you replied to.

This command sets up the trade session, allowing both users to add, remove, confirm, or cancel items before completing the trade.
