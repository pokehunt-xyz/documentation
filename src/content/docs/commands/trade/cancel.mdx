title: Trade cancel
description: Cancel a trade and get your items back
---

Use the command:
/trade cancel , 
to cancel an ongoing trade and retrieve all items, Pok√©mon, credits, and redeems that you added to the trade back into your inventory.

This command safely aborts the trade process so nothing is lost and both parties can start fresh or walk away without consequences.
