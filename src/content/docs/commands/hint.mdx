description: Get a hint for the spawned Pokémon name

Use the command:
/hint , 
to get a hint about the name of the most recently spawned Pokémon in the channel.

The bot will provide a partial clue, such as a few letters , to help you guess and catch the Pokémon. 
This is especially useful if you are unsure of the exact name or spelling.
Remember, the hint applies only to the latest Pokémon spawn and helps improve your chances of successful catching.
