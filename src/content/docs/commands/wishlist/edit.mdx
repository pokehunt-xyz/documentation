Use the command:  
/wishlist edit \<pokemon\> , 
to add or remove a Pokémon from your wishlist. 
Running the command once adds the Pokémon, running it again removes it.

Example usages:
/wishlist edit bulbasaur , 
Adds Bulbasaur to your wishlist. Run again to remove it.

/wishlist edit shiny bulbasaur , 
Adds the shiny version of Bulbasaur to your wishlist.

The wishlist helps you keep track of Pokémon you want to catch or trade for, making it easier to focus your hunting or trading efforts.
